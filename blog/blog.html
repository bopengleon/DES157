						SoundCloud's user interface is simple and straight forward, this is a good thing. By default, the home page highlights features available on the platform. Early startups benefit from this because they are trying to get users to use their product or service. There are some slight annoyances: some pages scroll vertically and not horizontally - consistency is important in UI design. Some elements pop up over other elements and can make the layout look really messy. The close image button is very small and not too close to the image – I’m sure most people would look at the top right hand side of the image for a close button rather than the top right hand side of the entire page… (You can play ‘Where’s Wally?’ with the close button on the image above, it’s there, honest.)
						Annoyances aside, its great. I truly believe Myspace could make a comeback, this is far from a social media prediction on my my behalf, it’s now down the the marketing and promotion, but as a message to Timberlake; if it doesn’t go quite right, don’t fire the designers, they’ve done a great job.

						Once they have established the website’s product search and online shopping capabilities, users will most likely want to take advantage of those features right away—starting with search.
						Amazon uses cookies to keep a user logged in, and that user’s shopping habits are tracked and stored server-side.
						This is a good enhancement, because it dynamically customizes the user’s experience based on prior searches, page views, wish-list additions, written reviews and, ultimately, purchases.
